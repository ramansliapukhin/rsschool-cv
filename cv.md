## About me

The ultimate goal of my studying is become web developer. Currently, in short-term, I'm focusing on broading my knowledge about web development and trying to build site and (maybe in near future) app for company that I'm working for (environmental engineering).

## My skills

HTML\
CSS\
JavaScript

## Code example

*Getting "Head" and "Tail" of random arrays in JavaScript:*

```
function head(x) {
  return x[0];
}
function tail(x) {
  let newArr = [...x];
  newArr.shift();
  return newArr;
}
function init(x) {
  let newArr = [...x];
  newArr.pop();
  return newArr;
}
function last(x) {
  return x[x.length - 1];
}
```
